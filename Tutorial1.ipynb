    "4.3- ** Data analysis with MapReduce ** Many people are curious about the cumulative credits they have per program. The grade dataset contains a description of the course (e.g., `IST101`) which consists of three letters for the program (e.g., `IST`) and three numbers for the course number (e.g., `101`). Using MapReduce, use the `grades_data_rdd` RDD to construct a MapReduce program that computes the total number of credits per program. **Hint**: Define a map function that takes the records in `grades_data_rdd` and generates appropriate key value pairs, where the key is the program. Then, define a reduce function that combines pairs of values appropriately."
